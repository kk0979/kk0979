Hi, i'm a korean who develop miscellaneous things.
My job is not relative to programming. i work in construction, but graduated in computer engineering.
I mainly used C/C++/Java to develop something
such like desktop app based on image processing, and web server publishing massive data.
Now, i'm learning deep machine learning and web front/back development at spare time after work off.
